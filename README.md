Naive Bayes Classifier gives great insights for some selected dataset.                                                                                                             
Though it is very well implemented in sklearn but where and how to apply NaiveBayes remains unanswerable. So,                                                                       
one should know how to code,assumptions involved, perform mathmatics and statistics on your own helping to figure:                                                                 
Discrete-Naive-Bayes,
Multinomial-Naive-Bayes,
Gaussian-Naive-Bayes.. etc
                                                                                                                                                                                   
Naïve: It is called Naïve because it assumes that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features.
Bayes: It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes' Theorem.

Dicrete_Naive_bayes contains implementaion of NaiveBayes classifier in Iris Dataset. My model distribute the iris data in 4 classes.    

    
        
           
             


Multinomial_Naive_bayes_contains implemenation of Multinomial NaiveBayes over a Group dataset.   
My model basically forms a dictionary of all the words present in nearly 20,000 files from 20 folders of different fields.  
Checks the Important words and remove stopwords from dictionary and than uses the data to build Naive Bayes to split data in 20 classes.                                           
#### Our end result is predicting the main topic of our file using the classifier. Very similarly we can predict genre of movie,recomendation for user in Netflix,IMDB dataset using description.             

I used Multinomial because our prediction is based on frequency of words in dictionary.




Since the model is self made accuracy of model is not good. I am working and your suggestions are welcomed.
