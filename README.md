# Discrete-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

Naive Bayes Classifier gives great insights for some selected dataset. 
Though it is very well implemented in sklearn but where and how to apply NaiveBayes remains unanswerable. So,
one should know how to code,assumptions involved, perform mathmatics and statistics on your own helping to figure:
Discrete-Naive-Bayes,
Multinomial-Naive-Bayes,
Gaussian-Naive-Bayes.. etc

Naïve: It is called Naïve because it assumes that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features.
Bayes: It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes' Theorem.
